    <h2>Initializing Frencil's Corner <span class="date">2014-10-30</span></h2>
    <p>My good friend <a href="http://squiggle.city/~brennen/">Brennen</a> set up this server - squiggle.city - modelled after tilde.club. Naturally I asked for an account immediately.</p>
    <p>Given the state of the various projects I have going right now, and in anticipation of life upheaval in the coming year, it seemed as good a place as any to start a little blog that nobody reads. I maintain the best blogs on the internet are ones with incredibly low readership because readership isn't a priority over just documenting thoughts and ideas. That's what this will be.</p>
    <p>Going forward this will probably mutate some but right now it appears this will be a place to ruminate on the twists and turns my personal projects take. Be they coding projects, photography / time lapse projects, astronomy projects, or whatever else, I'll spare some bit of creative energy to document what I'm thinking here. This is mainly an exercise for my future self to know a bit more about my past self, but if you've stumbled uppon this, I hope you've found something enjoyable.</p>
