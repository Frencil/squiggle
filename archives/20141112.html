    <h2>When Another You Creates Branches ~ <span class="date">2014-11-12</span></h2>
    <p>I picked up the nuclides project on my laptop tonight, only to find that the version on there was far more complete than what I'd been working on - something I didn't remember doing.</p>
    <p>It turns out earlier this year I must have copied just the data files manually from the <a href="https://github.com/Frencil/galaxy_of_nuclides">public repository</a> and started a fresh build of an interface to that data. In my last post I talked about getting something going on <a href="http://www.createjs.com/#!/CreateJS">Create.js</a> but at the time I didn't remember just how far I'd gotten. It turns out, <a href="http://nuclides.org/v2/">kinda far</a>. Surprising how one can forget entire episodes of projects.</p>
    <p>There was no <tt>.git</tt> directory in the local copy built this way, which is baffling. That wrong has been corrected with the <a href="https://github.com/Frencil/galaxy_of_nuclides/tree/canvas">canvas</a> branch on the public repo (but for now lets call it <b>version 2</b>, as if <b>version 1</b> was the original program in Processing). While it looks neat it is a dead end branch, as I'll describe below, but at least now it's preserved. If that link ever needs to come down for whatever reason here's what it looks like:</p>
    <figure>
      <a href="img/nuclides_v2_full.jpg"><img src="img/nuclides_v2_med.jpg"></a>
      <figcaption>The mysterious and fleeting version 2 of <a href="http://nuclides.org">Nuclides.org</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>As of this writing, the current D3 version (which would be <b>version 3</b>) deployed to <a href="http://nuclides.org">nuclides.org</a> is <i>way</i> less visually advanced. Version 2 has a functional transition between the periodic table and chart of nuclides as well as a meaningful color scale and carefully designed control buttons. So why walk away from it?</p>
    <p>Why I put it down is also why I so named the archival branch: <b>canvas</b>. This project is an entirely graphical interface so the choice of rendering environment is critical, and this version uses the HTML5 <tt>&lt;canvas&gt;</tt> element. Things were fast to spin up because I could just draw and figure out the structure as I went. Elements would appear with a z-index relative to when I rendered them, which was easy enough to grasp.</p>
    <p>But there were limitations that started to pile up. Everything was rendered in a rolled up function that would need to fire in full on every action: mouseover events, transitions scheduled with an arbitrary refresh rate via <tt>setTimeout()</tt>, and any future animations. Those mouseover events? Forget mouse input from the DOM. I had to reinvent that wheel myself by way of invisible rectangles and generic hit test functions. Need to remove a single graphical element from the view? Track visibility states on every element for when the render function redraws everything from blank canvas. Pray that redraw stays fast enough for users on underpowered machines as it grows in complexity. And now I remember: I abandoned this version precisely when realizing how tough it would be to build a basic slider for playing with half life data.</p>
    <p>So how has D3 and SVG held up by comparison? For starters, D3 took a fair bit longer to produce <i>any</i> visual result. Knowing the right way to do it would be to use selectors with the <tt>enter()</tt> method to dynamically generate SVG objects directly from the data set meant skipping the "Hello world" step of just drawing a rectangle. It was a slog of adapting documentation and examples to my unique dataset until it just worked but looked crummy. As I've worked with it, though, and developed a feel for how it organizes itself under the hood, it feels like the opposite is coming true: instead of an initially fast dev process that grinds down it's an initially slow dev process that affords faster development as I go. A big part of this was being forced to structure my data and my display as a unified chunk of nested markup. A bonus to doing this, and how SVG works, is I can explore my entire display down to individual graphical elements through the DOM inspector (where this was <i>totally</i> opaque inside the <tt>&lt;canvas&gt;</tt> element). That alone promises to expedite all future debugging and development by several orders of magnitude!</p>
    <p>So while it was neat to discover a branch I'd totally forgotten about (and be surprised by how far it went) it's helped bolster confidence that the new approach is the right one. Or, at least, a better one. Hopefully there won't need to be a <b>version 4</b>.</p>
