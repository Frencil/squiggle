    <h2>As the LHC Emerges from Hibernation ~ <span class="date">2015-03-02</span></h2>
    <p>It's an exciting time in the high energy particle physics world as the Large Hadron Collider, the largest particle accelerator at CERN, is <a href="http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2015/02/cerns-two-year-shutdown-drawing-close">due to come back online this spring</a>. Hot off the verified discovery of the elusive Higgs Boson but with much more to study the massive science experiement is returning to service tuned up for double its original operating energy.</p>
    <p>Particle phsyics has always been a fascinating subject for me. Honestly, how could exploring the most fundamental building blocks of everything our senses can sense (and a lot of things they can't) <i>not</i> be fascinating? I was lucky to be able to visit CERN in April of 2013, two months after this planned hiatus began and mere weeks after the <a href="http://press.web.cern.ch/press-releases/2013/03/new-results-indicate-particle-discovered-cern-higgs-boson">Higgs discovery</a> was confirmed. Despite all the recent excitement it was pretty quiet when we visited the campus in Meyren, Switxerland.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>One of the most amazing factoids I learned about CERN on my visit, especially given the time I was there, was the strange and gargantuan nature of their liquid helium usage. The LHC itself, along with all the massive detectors spread along the LHC's ring, tend to rely heavily on supercooled components. For the LHC itself it's those big magnet sections shown above - 1,232 in total - that all use superconducting magnets to work, and that requires temparatures approaching absolute zero. This takes a huge amount of liquid helium and a sophisticated plumbing system to move it around. According to one source the LHC requires upwards of <a href="http://www.academia.edu/6622843/The_liquid_helium_storage_system_for_the_Large_Hadron_Collider">140 tons</a> of it, and according to our tour guide that day when the LHC shuts down and warms up for prolonged maintenance (as it has been for the past two years) the on-site helium storage tanks are not enough. The solution is a special deal brokered with helium supply vendors that mandates they buy back as much helium as CERN has to sell whenever they need to sell it. Considering that helium is rapidly becoming a scarce resource it's pretty impressive how much of an impact the LHC's shutting down can have on the global helium market.</p>
    <p>As mentioned above the LHC is about 27km in circumference, buried underground. After returning from CERN I prepared a Lunch and Learn for where I worked at the time, SparkFun Electronics, all about CERN, the LHC, basic particle physics, the Higgs, etc. To drive home the scale of the entire facility I superimposed the LHC ring over our town of Boulder, CO with the ring passing over SparkFun's then headquarters on the northeast end of town. For those familiar with the Boulder area this map should make it clear just how massive the ring is. When considering this, also consider that the ring is engineered to sub-millimeter precision. It's just staggering!</p>

    </figure>
    <p>So what have the LHC's engineer's been up to in the past two years? In a nutshell, particle physics has operated for decades on the basic approach of slamming together particles at higher and higher energies to see what they're made of. The analogy of slamming two cars together to determine composition by the resulting debris is adequate: the faster you smash those cars together (or, more precisely, the more energy in the collision) the finer the debris becomes and you get a more fine-grained picture of what those things are made of. Particle accelerators measure collision energy in units of electron-volts and, as technology has advanced, new generations of accelerators tend toratchet up energy by entire orders of magnitude at a time. Here's an infographic I produced depicting the energies of all the major accelerators at CERN since its inception:</p>

      <figcaption>Chart depicting collision energies, dates of operation, and injection materials for various accelerators in CERN's history <a href="img/cern-accelerator-comparison.png">(click for full size)</a></figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Note above the LHC, in operation since 2008, has been operating at a collision energy of 7 TeV (or tera-electron-volts, as in seven trillion electron-volts). The bump to 14 TeV is precisely what the two year shutdown, now drawing to a close, was for. Having run the machine at a "safe" energy level for roughly five years the scientists and engineers had enough of an understanding of the device to know where it needed tuning up. Bumping to 14 TeV was planned as the maximum collision energy for which the LHC was designed. Now this doesn't mean it will max out at 14 TeV. I wouldn't be surprised if, after a few more years of operation (perhaps in the early 2020s) CERN brings the LHC down again with a fresh round of adjustments to push it beyond even this high threshold. Or as Ed Harris playing Gene Krantz in <i>Apollo 13</i> put it:</p>
    <blockquote>I don't care about what anything was <b>designed</b> to do, I care about what it <b>can</b> do.</blockquote>
    <p>I couldn't have said it better myself. Godspeed, scientists!</p>
