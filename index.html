  <h2>When another you creates branches <span class="date">2014-11-12</span></h2>
  <p>I picked up the nuclides project on my laptop tonight, only to find that the version on there was far more complete than what I'd been working on - something I didn't remember doing.</p>
  <p>It turns out earlier this year I must have copied just the data files manually from the <a href="https://github.com/Frencil/galaxy_of_nuclides">public repository</a> and started a fresh build of an interface to that data. In my last post I talked about getting something going on <a href="http://www.createjs.com/#!/CreateJS">Create.js</a> but at the time I didn't remember just how far I'd gotten. It turns out, <a href="http://nuclides.org/v2/">kinda far</a>. Surprising how one can forget entire episodes of projects.</p>
  <p>There was no <tt>.git</tt> directory in the local copy built this way, which is baffling. That wrong has been corrected with the <a href="https://github.com/Frencil/galaxy_of_nuclides/tree/canvas">canvas</a> branch on the public repo (but for now lets call it <b>version 2</b>, as if <b>version 1</b> was the original program in Processing). While it looks neat it is a dead end branch, as I'll describe below, but at least now it's preserved. If that link ever needs to come down for whatever reason here's what it looks like:</p>
  <center><a href="img/nuclides_v2_full.jpg"><img src="img/nuclides_v2_med.jpg"></a></center>
  <p>As of this writing, the current D3 version (which would be <b>version 3</b>) deployed to <a href="http://nuclides.org">nuclides.org</a> is <i>way</i> less visually advanced. Version 2 has a functional transition between the periodic table and chart of nuclides as well as a meaningful color scale and carefully designed control buttons. So why walk away from it?</p>
  <p>Why I put it down is also why I so named the archival branch: <b>canvas</b>. This project is an entirely graphical interface so the choice of rendering environment is critical, and this version uses the HTML5 <tt>&lt;canvas&gt;</tt> element. Things were fast to spin up because I could just draw and figure out the structure as I went. Elements would appear with a z-index relative to when I rendered them, which was easy enough to grasp.</p>
  <p>But there were limitations that started to pile up. Everything was rendered in a rolled up function that would need to fire in full on every action: mouseover events, transitions scheduled with an arbitrary refresh rate via <tt>setTimeout()</tt>, and any future animations. Those mouseover events? Forget mouse input from the DOM. I had to reinvent that wheel myself by way of invisible rectangles and generic hit test functions. Need to remove a single graphical element from the view? Track visibility states on every element for when the render function redraws everything from blank canvas. Pray that redraw stays fast enough for users on underpowered machines as it grows in complexity. And now I remember: I abandoned this version precisely when realizing how tough it would be to build a basic slider for playing with half life data.</p>
  <p>So how has D3 and SVG held up by comparison? For starters, D3 took a fair bit longer to produce <i>any</i> visual result. Knowing the right way to do it would be to use selectors with the <tt>enter()</tt> method to dynamically generate SVG objects directly from the data set meant skipping the "Hello world" step of just drawing a rectangle. It was a slog of adapting documentation and examples to my unique dataset until it just worked but looked crummy. As I've worked with it, though, and developed a feel for how it organizes itself under the hood, it feels like the opposite is coming true: instead of an initially fast dev process that grinds down it's an initially slow dev process that affords faster development as I go. A big part of this was being forced to structure my data and my display as a unified chunk of nested markup. A bonus to doing this, and how SVG works, is I can explore my entire display down to individual graphical elements through the DOM inspector (where this was <i>totally</i> opaque inside the <tt>&lt;canvas&gt;</tt> element). That alone promises to expedite all future debugging and development by several orders of magnitude!</p>
  <p>So while it was neat to discover a branch I'd totally forgotten about (and be surprised by how far it went) it's helped bolster confidence that the new approach is the right one. Or, at least, a better one. Hopefully there won't need to be a <b>version 4</b>.</p>

  <h2>Getting back into D3 <span class="date">2014-11-09</span></h2>
  <p>I spent most of the weekend dusting off an <a href="https://github.com/Frencil/galaxy_of_nuclides">old project</a>. The point of the project is mainly to play around with all the neat data surrounding elements and their nuclides. Maybe it'll also be a useful tool for teaching folks a bit more about atomic physics, too.</p>
  <p>A big part of the project was just <i>getting</i> the data in the first place, which I was able to get from the Brookhaven National Laboratory, but it needed a bit of massaging. Ultimately I created two CSV files: <a href="https://github.com/Frencil/galaxy_of_nuclides/blob/master/data/elements.csv">one for all elements on the periodic table of elements</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Frencil/galaxy_of_nuclides/blob/master/data/nuclides.csv">one for all nuclides on the chart of nuclides</a>.</p>
  <p>When I set out to port the two year old project from its original language of Processing to the web it was obvious that it needed to be built natively in JavaScript (yeah, I tried Processing.js but I was using some Java datatypes that Processing.js didn't support and the whole thing was a crutch anyway). Unsurprisingly I found a lot of different JavaScript libraries out there for doing interactive graphics, but it wasn't clear which one to use. I had something going for a while with <a href="http://www.createjs.com/#!/CreateJS">Create.js</a> but found I still needed a lot of helper libraries too, like jQuery and its associated CSV parsing lib. The project felt bloated before I even had any data parsed. It stalled and went back on the shelf.</p>
  <p>On coming back to the nuclides project with fresh vigor and perspective I remembered the gold standard: <b>D3</b>. I used D3 at SparkFun to build force-directed graph to display our company org chart. That was my first real look at the software, and it was adapted from an example I found online. The example was close enought to my use case - a means of representing relationships between people - that adaptation didn't require an intimate understanding of how everything was put together.</p>
  <p>Understanding that D3 would ultimately give the nuclides project the low-level control and flexibility I knew I would probably need in the long run I started from scratch, learning how to parse data and bind it to objects with selectors. Fortunately from another SparkFun project creating a detailed SVG map of the corporate headquarters and some side business helping patch a bug in a library I found for panning and zooming embedded SVGs I had some good SVG experience that was fresh in mind.</p>
  <p>The toughest part starting a D3 project with highly structured but complex data, as I found, is the lack of firm knowledge of what the visualization should look like. I know I want to represent my data as the periodic table and as the chart of nuclides. I know I'll want to interactively transition between them to show how they connect, as it's worked in the Processing version for years. Approaching the layout of the SVG itself has been very much trial and error thus far. At first I was just appending <tt>&lt;rect&gt;</tt> objects to the <tt>&lt;svg&gt;</tt> but quickly learned that <tt>&lt;text&gt;</tt> can't be a child of a <tt>&lt;rect&gt;</tt> such that it would show up how you would expect. If I wanted to associate elements it meant <tt>&lt;g&gt;</tt> tags. Lots and lots of <tt>&lt;g&gt;</tt> tags.</p>
  <p>At this weekend's stopping point here's a general summary of how I've chosen to structure the <tt>&lt;svg&gt;</tt>:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>All data is loaded through D3's built-in functions.</li>
    <li>All svg elements are created relying as much as possible on the conventions defined in D3's API (e.g. using <tt>.each()</tt> instead of <tt>foreach</tt> loops).</li>
    <li>All top-level elements in the <tt>&lt;svg&gt;</tt> are <tt>&lt;g&gt;</tt> tags, and there aren't many of them at the top level, so I can easily nuke and redraw the entire thing (for easier dynamic resizing).</li>
    <li>I have three general classes of <tt>&lt;g&gt;</tt> objects:
      <ul>
        <li><tt>group</tt> is for a <tt>&lt;g&gt;</tt> that contains a list of other <tt>&lt;g&gt;</tt> tags (e.g. all of the elements or all the nuclides for an element).</li>
        <li><tt>shell</tt> is for a <tt>&lt;g&gt;</tt> that represents a single object from the data set and all of its constituent pieces, be they shown or not (e.g. a single element or nuclide).</li>
        <li><tt>display</tt> is for all the <tt>&lt;rect&gt;</tt>, <tt>&lt;text&gt;</tt>, and whatever else is used to actually display a thing.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The general classes of <tt>&lt;g&gt;</tt> tags are used to aid selection of collections of elements that need to move and change together.</li>
    <li><tt>&lt;g&gt;</tt> tags are positioned using dynamically generated <tt>translate()</tt> functions with <tt>transform</tt> attributes. This allows for positioning elements inside groups using relative coordinates and dramatically cuts down on coordinate translation overhead that I have to code myself.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Given the above I've ended up with an <tt>&lt;svg&gt;</tt> that looks something like this:</p>
  <pre>
&lt;svg&gt;
  &lt;g class="element_group"&gt;
    &lt;g class="element_shell"&gt;
      &lt;g class="element_display"&gt;
        &lt;rect&gt;
        &lt;text&gt;
      &lt;/g&gt;
      &lt;g class="nuclide_group"&gt;
        &lt;g class="nuclide_shell"&gt;
          &lt;g class="nuclide_display"&gt;
            &lt;rect&gt;
          &lt;/g&gt;
        &lt;/g&gt;
        ...
      &lt;/g&gt;
    &lt;/g&gt;
    ...
  &lt;/g&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;
  </pre>
  <p>I've had this setup for a day and I like it. The next hurdle is to really leverage transitions to make the periodic-table-to-chart-of-nuclides animation (and it's reverse) look as neat as it does in my head. I hope I can get it working cleanly without having to rethink all this scaffolding.

  <h2>Initializing Frencil's Corner <span class="date">2014-10-30</span></h2>
  <p>My good friend <a href="http://squiggle.city/~brennen/">Brennen</a> set up this server - squiggle.city - modelled after tilde.club. Naturally I asked for an account immediately.</p>
  <p>Given the state of the various projects I have going right now, and anticipate life upheaval in the coming year, it seemed as good a place as any to start a little blog that nobody reads. I maintain the best blogs on the internet are ones with incredibly low readership because readership isn't a priority over just documenting thoughts and ideas. That's what this will be.</p>
  <p>Going forward this will probably mutate some but right now it appears this will be a place to ruminate on the twists and turns my personal projects take - be they coding projects, photography / time lapse projects, astronomy projects, or whatever else. If you're here to see it I hope you find something enjoyable.</p>
