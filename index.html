    <h2>When the Big Five become the Big Four <span class="date">2014-12-17</span></h2>
    <p>It's time for a digression where geopolitics and international commerce intersect with the medium-sized web company where I work, <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/">SparkFun</a>.</p>
    <p>There's a list of five countries that we, as an American company, can never ever ever <i>ever</i> ship to for any reason whatsoever:</p>
    <ul><li>Iran</li><li>Libya</li><li>Syria</li><li>North Korea</li><li>Cuba</li></ul>
    <p>I had to hard-code that list deep in the order/shipping systems of proto-Sparkle (SparkFun's internal ERP system) back in 2006. It's still in there, somewhere, today. This <b>"big five"</b> list as kept by the US Government has looked just like this for longer than many of us have been alive.</p>
    <p>But yesterday the last holdup in a warming of US/Cuba relations was addressed as Cuba released a wrongly-imprisoned American contractor. Obama chatted with Castro (Raul) on the phone, breaking a decades-long silence between the countries' leadership. And then today the news broke:</p>
    <p><b><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/18/world/americas/us-cuba-relations.html?_r=0">Obama Announces U.S. and Cuba Will Resume Relations</a></b></p>
    <p>It's a rare event that an entire country has relations opened back up across the board like this. It's reminiscent of Nixon opening relations with China in 1971, and now as then, it's steeped in nuance. Cuba is still registered as a terrorist state in the US (though the president has signaled his intent to change that). Travel and banking restrictions are to be loosened across many categories, import restrictions are also to be loosened somewhat (might be easier to get cigars next year!), and a heap of other things. It's all in flux, and still coalescing, but a pretty big deal nonetheless.</p>
    <p>For SparkFun, a Colorado company that ships world-wide, this means in 2015 or soon thereafter the Department of Commerce may open limited trade with Cuba, and we may get to start shipping stuff there. Were that to happen then deep in the guts of Sparkle we would get to strike one country from the "big five" never-ship list. While there would surely be plenty of work for CS and IT to figure out how to ship stuff there in compliance with the law and our shipping providers, to me that small change in code would be a fitting symbol of an increasingly globalized world that's figuring out how to just get along with each other already. And that's pretty neat.</p>

    <p>For a good read on what Cuba is like in the 21st century I recommend <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2012/11/new-cuba/gorney-text">Cuba's New Now</a>, an excellent piece from the November 2012 issue of National Geographic. Learning about Cuba's bizarre dual currency system alone makes the whole read very worth it.</p>
    <p>Yay peace. =)</p>
